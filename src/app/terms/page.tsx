      <div className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none space-y-4">
        <p>Effective Date: 4 November 2025</p>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between MediMan Life (Pvt) Ltd (referred to as “Mediman”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a company incorporated in Sri Lanka, and each user of the Mediman platform (referred to as “you” or “your”). Users include both healthcare practitioners (e.g. doctors and other licensed providers) and patients using Mediman’s telehealth platform . By creating an account, verifying your contact information, and clicking “I Agree,” or by otherwise accessing or using the Mediman website or mobile application (“Platform”), you consent to and accept these Terms electronically . If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately discontinue use of the Platform . These Terms incorporate by reference Mediman’s Privacy Policy and any other policies, guidelines, or rules published on the Platform (e.g. Refund & Cancellation policies), which you also agree to by using the Platform . 1. Definitions</p>
        <p>For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:</p>
        <p>“Platform” refers to the Mediman web and mobile application and related services that facilitate telehealth interactions. “Practitioner” (also “Healthcare Provider” or “Doctor”) means a licensed medical or healthcare professional who registers to offer consultations through the Platform . “Patient” means any person registering on the Platform to obtain healthcare services from a Practitioner. “User” means any individual using the Platform, whether as a Patient or as a Practitioner. “Consultation” refers to a telehealth interaction (or an in-person appointment arranged via the Platform) between a Patient and a Practitioner, including any advice, diagnosis, treatment, or prescription provided. “MediPurse” refers to the digital wallet feature of the Platform that holds credit balances for Users (separately tracked as MediPurse–Patient or MediPurse–Doctor for each user type) for the purposes of managing payments, refunds, and earnings within the Platform. “PHI” means Protected Health Information or any personal medical data about a patient. Other Defined Terms: Additional terms may be defined elsewhere in these Terms. Defined terms shall have the same meaning throughout this Agreement.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Scope of Services & Relationship</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.1 Platform Services: Mediman operates a digital health technology platform that facilitates the discovery of healthcare providers, scheduling of appointments, video/audio telehealth consultations, payment processing, and post-consultation workflows . Through the Platform, Users can, among other things: (a) search for and book online or in-person consultations with licensed doctors or other healthcare professionals; (b) access their e-prescriptions, medical records, and appointment history; (c) communicate with Practitioners via secure video or audio channels; and (d) make electronic payments for consultations and related healthcare services . Mediman may from time to time introduce new features or services to enhance the healthcare experience, all of which will be subject to these Terms.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.2 No Medical Provider: Mediman is a technology intermediary and facilitator, not a medical or healthcare provider . Mediman does not practice medicine, does not employ or supervise the healthcare practitioners, and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or prescriptions itself . Any medical or health-related services accessed through the Platform are provided solely by independent third-party Practitioners who are not employees or agents of Mediman. The doctor–patient relationship exists exclusively between the Patient and the Practitioner you select for a Consultation . Mediman does not control a Practitioner’s clinical judgment or the content of any advice or treatment that a Practitioner provides . You acknowledge that Mediman does not guarantee the availability, suitability, or quality of any particular Practitioner or service, and that any ratings or information on the Platform are for general guidance and do not constitute an endorsement.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.3 Independent Practitioners: All Practitioners on the Platform provide services as independent professionals. Nothing in these Terms is intended to create an employment, agency, partnership, fiduciary, or joint venture relationship between Mediman and any Practitioner . Practitioners are solely responsible for the care and services they provide, including all clinical decisions, medical judgments, diagnoses, treatments, prescriptions, referrals, follow-up, and required documentation . Practitioners must obtain their own necessary professional licenses and maintain responsibility for compliance with all legal and ethical obligations governing their profession. Mediman does not direct or control how a Practitioner provides medical services and does not assume any liability for a Practitioner’s acts or omissions.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.4 No Emergency Services: The Platform is not intended for use in medical emergencies or urgent situations. You must not use Mediman if you believe you are experiencing a medical emergency. In the event of an emergency or any condition requiring immediate or in-person care, call your local emergency number or seek care at the nearest emergency facility immediately, rather than using Mediman. Practitioners on the Platform may, if they determine during a Consultation that a Patient’s condition is emergent or beyond the scope of telehealth, terminate or redirect the session and advise the Patient to seek emergency or in-person care. Mediman is not liable for any delay or failure in seeking emergency treatment by a user of the Platform. 3. User Eligibility & Registration</h3>
        <p>To use the Platform, you must meet the following eligibility criteria and registration requirements:</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.1 Patients: Patients must be at least 18 years old to register and use Mediman independently . If you are under 18 (a minor), you may only use the Platform with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian, who must supervise the consultation and agree to these Terms on the minor’s behalf . Patients agree to provide true, accurate, and complete personal information during registration (such as name, contact information, and medical history) and to keep such information updated. Misrepresentation or falsification of your identity, health information, or payment details is strictly prohibited and may result in suspension or termination of your account, as well as potential legal action . You may not share your account credentials with anyone else or impersonate any other individual when using the Platform .</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.2 Practitioners: To register and serve as a Practitioner on Mediman, you must meet stringent eligibility requirements. By signing up as a Practitioner, you represent and warrant that you: (a) hold a valid and active professional license/registration in every jurisdiction in which you provide consultations via Mediman ; (b) will practice in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including telehealth and telemedicine rules, any limitations on cross-border practice, e-prescribing regulations (especially for controlled substances), and other healthcare requirements in the locations of both you and your patients ; (c) maintain any required professional indemnity or medical malpractice insurance in the amounts required by law or good practice, and will provide proof of such coverage to Mediman upon request ; and (d) are, and will remain, in good standing with your professional regulatory body (e.g., Medical Council or licensing board) and not subject to any active sanctions or disciplinary actions that would preclude you from practicing or using the Platform . Mediman reserves the right to verify these qualifications and to refuse or revoke Practitioner access if these criteria are not met or maintained.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.3 Onboarding and Verification: Practitioners agree to participate in Mediman’s onboarding and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and credential verification processes . You authorize Mediman to confirm your identity, credentials, licensure, qualifications, and professional standing through appropriate means, which may include verifying documents, contacting licensing bodies or employers, checking sanction lists or exclusion databases (e.g., for fraud or AML compliance), and performing background checks as permitted by law . You agree to promptly provide any additional information or documentation that Mediman may request for verification or compliance purposes. Until verification is successfully completed, Mediman may limit or restrict a Practitioner’s ability to offer consultations.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.4 Account Information: All Users (Patients and Practitioners alike) agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating an account, including (as applicable) your legal name, contact information (email, phone number, physical address), identification details, and any other information required by Mediman. Practitioners must also provide complete profile information such as professional credentials, registration numbers, qualifications, areas of practice or specialization, clinic details, and bank or payout details . You are responsible for updating your account promptly with any changes to your information (e.g., a change of address, email, phone number, or for Practitioners, any change in licensing status or banking details) to ensure records remain accurate . Providing false, misleading, or outdated information is a breach of these Terms and could result in account suspension or termination. 4. Account Security and User Responsibilities</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.1 Account Confidentiality: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials. This applies to both Patients and Practitioners. Do not share your username, password, authentication codes, or any login method with anyone else. If you suspect that someone else has gained access to your account, you must notify Mediman immediately. All activity conducted through your account is deemed to be authorized by you; thus, you will be held accountable for any actions taken or agreements made through your account (unless you have previously reported the account compromise to Mediman) .</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.2 Security Measures: Mediman recommends and may require implementation of enhanced security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) for account access . You agree to use secure, up-to-date devices and software, and to access the Platform over secure networks when possible. Practitioners, in particular, should use devices that are encrypted and protected (e.g., with strong passwords or biometric locks) to prevent unauthorized access to patient data. All Users should regularly update their passwords and use strong password practices. You must immediately inform Mediman if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.3 Official Notices: You agree that Mediman’s official notices and communications to you may be provided electronically. Mediman will send official notices (including notices of changes to these Terms, privacy updates, account status alerts, or other important account-related notifications) to the email address registered in your account and/or by displaying a notification within your user dashboard or in-app notification center . You are responsible for keeping your registered email address and other contact information current and accurate, and for regularly monitoring for communications from Mediman. Notices will be deemed received by you when sent or posted by Mediman. If we send a notice to your email and it is returned as undeliverable, we may suspend your account until you provide a valid email address.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.4 Account Use and Third Parties: You may not allow any other person to use your Mediman account, except that a parent or legal guardian may create and manage an account on behalf of a minor child or dependent (as permitted under Section 3.1 above). Practitioners must not permit any unregistered assistant or substitute to conduct consultations under their account. You also agree not to create multiple accounts for the same person or entity without permission, and not to create an account on behalf of someone else (except as legally authorized for minors or dependents). Mediman is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these account security obligations. 5. Platform Usage Guidelines & User Conduct</h3>
        <p>All Users are expected to use the Platform in a lawful, respectful, and responsible manner. By using Mediman, you agree to the following general usage guidelines and specific conduct rules:</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.1 Lawful and Intended Use: You agree to use the Platform strictly for legitimate healthcare-related purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations . The Platform is provided for personal and professional use in facilitating healthcare services; you shall not use the Platform for any unlawful, fraudulent, or commercial purpose outside the scope of Mediman’s services. Patients agree that they will use Mediman only for personal health consultations for themselves or those under their care, and not for curiosity, entertainment, data mining, or any non-healthcare use. Practitioners agree to use the Platform only for providing professional telehealth consultations, sharing health-related information, and managing patient interactions in accordance with these Terms and applicable law. Any other use is prohibited.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.2 Appropriate Behavior: All interactions on Mediman—whether written, verbal, or visual—must be conducted with professionalism and respect. You shall not post, transmit, or communicate any content that is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, harassing, threatening, abusive, hateful, or otherwise offensive or unlawful . Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior by any user (patient or practitioner) is strictly forbidden . This includes (but is not limited to) offensive comments related to race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other personal characteristic. Mediman reserves the right to remove any content or messages that violate these standards and to suspend or terminate the accounts of Users who engage in such behavior.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.3 Prohibited Conduct – Patients: In addition to the general obligations above, Patients shall not engage in the following prohibited activities on the Platform :</h3>
        <p>False Information: Do not use false identities, create accounts under a fake name or someone else’s name, or provide any information that is untrue or misleading during consultations or in your profile . Multiple/Fraudulent Accounts: Do not create multiple patient accounts to game any system (such as promotional credits or to leave multiple reviews), or otherwise manipulate the Platform’s features. Recording & Privacy Violations: You must not record, photograph, or otherwise capture any part of a consultation (audio, video, or text) without the express consent of the Practitioner and any other participant . Likewise, you shall not distribute or share any consultation recordings or communications to third parties without permission. Unauthorized recording may violate privacy laws and these Terms. Circumvention: Do not attempt to circumvent the Platform by soliciting a Practitioner to provide services outside of Mediman. For example, you should not request a Practitioner’s personal contact details to seek treatment or payment off-platform. (Note: Practitioners are similarly prohibited from soliciting Patients off-platform – see below.) Technical Misuse: You shall not tamper with the Platform’s technology. This means you must not attempt to hack, reverse-engineer, disable, or interfere with any feature of the Platform, including security-related features, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Platform’s systems or data . Improper Content Use: You may not upload or transmit any malicious code, viruses, or harmful content, nor engage in any activities that could harm or overload the Platform’s infrastructure (such as a denial-of-service attack).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.4 Prohibited Conduct – Practitioners: In addition to the general obligations and the standards of professionalism expected in Section 7 below, Practitioners using Mediman must not engage in the following prohibited activities :</h3>
        <p>Off-Platform Solicitation: You shall not request, encourage, or agree to continue a Mediman-originated patient consultation outside of the Platform for the purpose of avoiding Platform fees or any other reason. This includes soliciting Patients to contact you via personal phone, email, or other channels to obtain medical advice or services, and it includes accepting payments outside the Platform for consultations that originated on Mediman . (Emergency situations excepted, where a referral off-platform is medically necessary – see Section 7.1(e)). Mediman may treat attempts to move consultations or payments off-platform as a serious violation, potentially resulting in financial penalties or account termination . Improper Payments: Do not accept or request payment from Patients except through the authorized Mediman payment systems. Circumvention of the payment system (by asking Patients to pay cash, transfer money privately, or use any method outside Mediman’s provided gateways) is strictly prohibited. Such circumvention may result in loss of earned fees and the suspension or termination of your account. Privacy Violations: You must not share, disclose, or publish any Patient’s personal data or protected health information (PHI) outside of the Platform’s secure channels, except as required for lawful care or documentation and in compliance with privacy laws . This means you cannot copy consultation details or patient records to personal devices or messaging apps that are not secure, except as necessary for legal medical record-keeping as allowed by law (see Section 10 and 11 for data handling requirements). Any marketing or content you create must not include identifiable patient information without explicit consent. Prescription Abuse: You must not prescribe any controlled or restricted substances via the Platform if it is prohibited by law, or without following all legally required protocols . You also must not prescribe medications or provide treatment recommendations without appropriate evaluation (e.g., prescribing antibiotics or other drugs without sufficient patient history or indication). All prescriptions must comply with the laws of the Patient’s and your jurisdiction, and with professional guidelines. Outcome Guarantees and Misrepresentation: You shall not make any guarantees of specific outcomes or cures to Patients, nor engage in any form of misleading advertising or self-promotion . All information you provide about your qualifications, experience, and the services you will provide must be truthful. You must adhere to any professional advertising rules, meaning you cannot, for example, advertise yourself with superlatives that violate medical advertising standards or claim specialty certifications you do not possess (see Section 11 on compliance). Unprofessional Behavior: You must not harass or discriminate against any Patient or Platform staff, nor exhibit unprofessional conduct such as using profanity or derogatory language during consultations . Practitioners are expected to maintain professional boundaries at all times. Any form of sexual harassment or inappropriate personal relationship solicitation with Patients is strictly forbidden.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.5 Content and Community Guidelines: User-Generated Content: If the Platform allows you to post or upload any content (for example, messages in chat, medical advice summaries, Practitioner-authored educational articles or answers in forums, profile information, or Patient reviews of Practitioners), you agree to post content that is accurate, relevant, respectful, and lawful. You must not post any content containing PHI or other personal data of any individual (other than your own information) in public or community sections of the Platform . Practitioners who contribute articles, answers, or “MedTalks” educational content must ensure such content is medically accurate, generic (not personalized medical advice), and not promotional of your own services or products . You grant Mediman a non-exclusive license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute any content you submit on the Platform for the purpose of operating and promoting the services . Mediman may moderate or remove content at its discretion if the content violates these Terms or applicable law, or for technical and operational reasons .</h3>
        <p>Ratings & Reviews: Patients may have the opportunity to rate and review Practitioners after consultations. If you choose to leave a review, you agree to be fair and truthful in your feedback. Reviews must not contain offensive, defamatory, or false statements. Mediman may utilize and display these ratings and reviews (including aggregated ratings) to inform other users. While Mediman is not responsible for the content of user reviews, it reserves the right to remove reviews that are abusive, irrelevant, or clearly violate our content policies or the law (for example, hate speech or harassment in a review) . However, lawful and constructive criticism will not be removed simply because it is negative . Practitioners acknowledge that they may receive feedback from Patients publicly, and by using the Platform they consent to this process. Practitioners have an opportunity to respond to reviews in a professional manner. Any attempt by Practitioners to manipulate or suppress reviews (such as by incentivizing positive reviews or retaliating against a patient for a negative review) is prohibited.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.6 Suspension for Misconduct: Mediman reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account for any misconduct or violation of the above conduct rules . Decisions regarding suspension or termination will consider the severity and impact of the violation. In some cases, Mediman may issue a warning or require additional training (for Practitioners) for minor first-time offenses, but is not obligated to provide notice before suspension for serious violations. Users who believe a suspension is in error may contact Mediman support to dispute the decision, but Mediman’s determination will be final. Additionally, Mediman may report any unlawful conduct to appropriate authorities as required by law. 6. Telehealth Consultations & Patient Care Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>This section outlines the obligations and standards for Practitioners in delivering telehealth services via Mediman, as well as the responsibilities and acknowledgments of Patients receiving those services. Both user types must understand and adhere to these protocols to ensure safe and effective care.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.1 Practitioner Clinical Standards: When providing consultations through Mediman, Practitioners agree to uphold the highest standards of professional practice and patient care. Practitioners shall :</h3>
        <p>Patient Identification & Consent: Verify the Patient’s identity at the start of each consultation (e.g., by confirming name, date of birth, or using Platform verification features) and obtain the Patient’s informed consent appropriate for telehealth services before proceeding . This includes explaining the nature of telehealth, its limitations (such as potential lack of physical examination), and obtaining the Patient’s agreement to proceed under these conditions. Practitioners should document that consent was obtained. Preparation & Review: Review the Patient’s relevant medical history and information available (such as prior records, intake forms, lab results, or images) in advance or at the beginning of the consultation . Ensure you have an understanding of the Patient’s current medications, allergies, and primary complaints before providing advice . If necessary information is not available, ask the Patient to provide it during the consultation. Scope of Practice: Provide medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment only within your professional competence and lawful scope of practice . You must not attempt to manage conditions via telehealth that are beyond what you can safely address without an in-person exam, unless no immediate alternative is available and you take appropriate steps (such as advising urgent in-person follow-up). Adhere to all clinical guidelines and protocols applicable to your specialty for telemedicine. Quality of Care: Communicate clearly and effectively. Use language that the Patient can understand, avoid medical jargon or explain it when used, and be attentive to the Patient’s questions and concerns. Maintain a respectful and culturally sensitive manner throughout the consultation . Ensure that you devote the appropriate amount of time and focus to the Patient, consistent with the booked consultation length, and do not rush or truncate consultations without good reason. Emergency or In-Person Care: Continuously assess whether the telehealth format is appropriate during the consultation. If at any point a Patient’s condition appears to require emergency intervention or an in-person assessment, you must escalate or refer the Patient to emergency services or an appropriate in-person provider without delay . This may involve advising the Patient to call emergency services (or contacting emergency services on the Patient’s behalf if the situation is critical and sufficient information is available), or directing the Patient to seek immediate care at a hospital/clinic. In non-emergent cases where telehealth is insufficient, advise the Patient to schedule an in-person follow-up and provide guidance on the urgency. Document any such advice or actions in the consultation record. Practitioners will not be penalized for ending a telehealth session early in order to direct a Patient to emergency care if the circumstances reasonably warrant it. Minors and Vulnerable Patients: Follow all protocols for treating minors or other vulnerable populations via telehealth . If consulting with a minor, ensure that a parent or legal guardian is present (except where the minor is legally permitted to seek confidential services) and that appropriate consent is obtained from the guardian. Be mindful of any legal requirements for adolescent privacy. For patients who are elderly, disabled, or otherwise vulnerable, ensure they have the necessary support during and after the consultation, and involve caregivers or guardians as appropriate. Conflict of Interest: Disclose any material conflicts of interest that may affect your consultation . For example, if you have a financial stake in a pharmacy, lab, or medical device that you are recommending to the Patient, you should inform the Patient of this relationship. Avoid any self-dealing or inappropriate self-promotion. You must not use consultations as an opportunity to inappropriately market unrelated products or services to Patients.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.2 Consultation Procedures and Follow-Up (Practitioners): In addition to the above standards, Practitioners should adhere to proper telehealth workflow practices:</h3>
        <p>Professional Environment: At the scheduled time of the consultation, ensure you are in a private, well-lit, and quiet environment with a stable internet connection  . Dress and present yourself professionally, as you would in an office setting. Make sure your camera, microphone, and any necessary medical devices or tools are functioning correctly beforehand. Pre-Call Checks: Confirm the technical readiness of both sides. If the Patient is having difficulty connecting, use any provided in-app tools or support channels to resolve the issue. Verify at the start of the call that the Patient can see and hear you clearly (and vice versa). During Consultation: Conduct the consultation in a patient-centered manner. Allow the Patient to describe their concerns without unnecessary interruption. Perform any feasible exam elements via video (e.g., asking the Patient to show a rash, or perform a self-exam with guidance) and take detailed notes. Clinical Documentation: Document the consultation thoroughly and accurately in the Platform’s records or as otherwise provided (see Section 6.3 below and Section 10 on data retention). This includes the key findings, your assessment or diagnosis, and the plan. Post-Consultation Guidance: Provide clear follow-up instructions to the Patient. If you are making a referral (e.g., to a specialist or for a lab test), explain the next steps and any timeline. If you issue an e-prescription, do so through the Platform (if available) or follow the appropriate e-prescribing process compliant with local law . Advise the Patient on any “red flag” symptoms to watch for that would warrant immediate medical attention (this is often called “safety-net advice”). Timing: Adhere to the scheduled consultation length as closely as possible, ensuring the Patient receives the allotted time. If a consultation runs longer due to medical necessity, use your judgment; minor extensions are often acceptable to conclude a visit appropriately. If a session is significantly shorter than booked (e.g., because the Patient did not show or ended early), make sure to follow the policies for such events (see Section 8 on Cancellations/No-Shows for how fees are handled in those cases).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.3 Patient Responsibilities in Consultations: As a Patient, you also bear responsibilities to ensure a successful telehealth experience:</h3>
        <p>Accurate Medical History: You must disclose complete and accurate medical information to the Practitioner . This includes your symptoms, past illnesses or surgeries, chronic conditions, medications you are currently taking (including over-the-counter drugs or supplements), allergies, and any other relevant health data . Failure to provide important information could adversely affect the quality and safety of the care you receive . You acknowledge that Practitioners will rely on the information you provide and on the limited examination possible via telehealth, and that this may affect their ability to diagnose or treat you. If you remember or receive new information after the consultation that might be relevant (for example, recalling an allergy or receiving a lab result), inform your Practitioner as soon as possible through the Platform’s messaging feature or in a follow-up visit. Consultation Environment: You should join the telehealth session on time (it is recommended to connect 5–10 minutes early to troubleshoot any technical issues) . Ensure you are in a private, well-lit, and quiet environment where you feel comfortable discussing your health . Minimize distractions (e.g., turn off TV/radio, do not drive during the session). Have a stable internet connection; if using a mobile device, ensure you have a good signal or Wi-Fi connection. For video visits, it’s helpful to test your camera and microphone beforehand. Follow Instructions: During the consultation, follow the Practitioner’s instructions, such as performing certain movements on camera or checking your own vitals if possible (e.g., using a home thermometer or blood pressure cuff if available). Ask questions if you do not understand something. After the consultation, follow the treatment plan and advice given by the Practitioner. This includes taking medications as prescribed, obtaining recommended tests, seeking in-person care if advised, or scheduling follow-up appointments. If you decide not to follow a recommendation, you should inform the Practitioner so they are aware and can advise you of potential risks. Telehealth Limitations: You acknowledge that a telehealth consultation has limitations compared to an in-person examination. There is potential for a Practitioner not to see or recognize certain signs due to video or audio quality or the inherent constraints of not being physically present. By proceeding with a telehealth consultation, you accept these limitations and agree to proceed at your own risk to the extent permissible by law. You also agree that if the Practitioner determines your issue cannot be fully resolved via telehealth, you will follow their guidance to seek in-person care or emergency care as appropriate. Informed Consent to Telehealth: By booking and participating in a telehealth consultation on Mediman, you consent to receive healthcare services via telecommunication technologies. You understand that such services may involve the communication of your medical information electronically, and you agree to this transfer of information. You have the right to ask questions about the telehealth process and can withdraw consent to telehealth during a consultation if you are uncomfortable (however, understand that this may require terminating the session and seeking care by other means). Emergency Plan: If during a consultation you experience a medical emergency (for example, severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, sudden confusion, etc.), you should immediately notify the Practitioner (if possible) and seek emergency assistance. If a serious issue arises and you are unable to communicate effectively, the Practitioner may notify emergency contacts or services if they have location information, but the primary responsibility to seek emergency care rests with you as the Patient. Never delay seeking emergency care because you are waiting for a telehealth appointment or are in the middle of one — your safety is paramount.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.4 Medical Disclaimers: Both Patients and Practitioners should note the following important disclaimers related to telehealth consultations on Mediman:</h3>
        <p>No Guaranteed Results: Medicine is not an exact science. Practitioners cannot and do not guarantee particular outcomes or cures for the Patient. Any prognosis or outlook given is an educated opinion, not a promise. Patients should understand that a telehealth Practitioner may advise them based on limited information and that if symptoms persist or worsen, they should seek further evaluation. Patient’s Choice: Patients acknowledge that they have chosen their Practitioner freely from the available providers on the Platform and that Mediman has not recommended any particular Practitioner. By booking a specific doctor or healthcare provider, you accept responsibility for that choice and for following through with the care plan decided between you and the Practitioner . Mediman is not responsible for any decision you make to accept or reject a Practitioner’s advice. Patient Decision-Making: Any decisions regarding your health (including decisions to follow or not follow medical advice) are made voluntarily by you as the Patient. You assume full responsibility for the outcomes of your decisions relating to the medical care you receive via Mediman . If you ever feel you need a second opinion or in-person evaluation, you are encouraged to seek one.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Appointment Booking, Cancellation, Rescheduling & Refunds</h2>
        <p>Mediman strives to facilitate a smooth scheduling process for both Patients and Practitioners. The following terms govern how appointments are booked, canceled, or rescheduled, and how refunds or credits are handled in various scenarios. Both Patients and Practitioners are expected to familiarize themselves with these policies to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.1 Booking Consultations: All consultations (whether online telehealth sessions or in-person appointments arranged via the Platform) must be booked through the Platform’s scheduling system . Patients will select an available time slot offered by their chosen Practitioner and confirm the booking by providing payment information for the consultation fee (see Section 8 on Payments). A booking is not confirmed until full payment (or an authorized charge) for the consultation is processed at the time of scheduling . The Platform will provide a booking confirmation via app notification or email. Practitioners are responsible for keeping their available time slots up to date (see Practitioner obligations in Section 5.5 and 11 regarding schedule accuracy). Do not attempt to schedule consultations with a Practitioner outside of the Platform for initial bookings, as such appointments are not covered by Mediman’s policies and protections.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.2 Patient No-Shows & Technical Issues: Patients are encouraged to join the online session 5–10 minutes early to ensure their connection, audio, and video are functioning properly . If a Patient is late to a live consultation, the Practitioner will generally wait at least the scheduled duration of the appointment or a minimum grace period (e.g., 10 minutes for a shorter consultation) for the Patient to arrive. If the Patient fails to join the session or is unreachable within a reasonable time, this will be treated as a Patient no-show. Missed sessions or technical difficulties on the Patient’s side (such as device failures or connectivity problems that are not attributable to the Platform) are not eligible for a refund , except as provided under the refund policy below. The Practitioner may in some cases offer at their discretion to reschedule the appointment, but this is not guaranteed and standard policies will apply. Patients should ensure they are in a stable internet environment to avoid such issues.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.3 Cancellation by Patients: If you need to cancel a scheduled consultation as a Patient, you must do so through the Platform’s interface (or by contacting customer support as directed) as early as possible. The following Patient cancellation refund policy applies, based on the time remaining before the appointment start time at the moment of confirmed cancellation :</h3>
        <p>Time Before Appointment (Patient Cancellation)</p>
        <p>Refund Eligibility</p>
        <p>More than 24 hours in advance</p>
        <p>100% refund of the Practitioner’s consultation fee .</p>
        <p>12 to 24 hours in advance</p>
        <p>50% refund of the consultation fee .</p>
        <p>6 to 12 hours in advance</p>
        <p>25% refund of the consultation fee .</p>
        <p>Less than 6 hours, or No-show</p>
        <p>No refund (0% of the fee is refunded) .</p>
        <p>The above policy means that if you cancel well in advance, you can receive a full or substantial refund of the doctor’s fee. As the appointment time grows closer, a larger portion of the fee is forfeit because the Practitioner has reserved that time and may not be able to re-book it. If you fail to show up for your appointment or cancel just before it starts (within 6 hours), you will not receive a refund for the consultation fee . Note that Mediman’s platform or transaction fees (if any were charged at booking) may be non-refundable as described in Section 8.4.</p>
        <p>To cancel an appointment, follow the instructions in the app/website to cancel. The effective time of cancellation is when you complete the cancellation action and receive a cancellation confirmation. Mediman’s system will automatically calculate any refund due based on the above policy.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.4 Cancellation by Practitioners: In rare cases, a Practitioner might need to cancel a scheduled consultation (for instance, due to an emergency or illness). Practitioners are expected to cancel only when absolutely necessary (see Section 11.1 on reliability), but if a Practitioner cancellation occurs, the Patient will always receive a full refund for that appointment. Additionally, when a Practitioner cancels on short notice, the Patient may receive a credit or compensation for the inconvenience. The Practitioner cancellation policy for patient compensation is as follows :</h3>
        <p>Time Before Appointment (Practitioner Cancellation)</p>
        <p>Patient Compensation</p>
        <p>More than 12 hours in advance</p>
        <p>Full refund of the consultation fee (100%) .</p>
        <p>9 to 12 hours in advance</p>
        <p>Full refund + LKR 10 (approximately USD 0.05) credit to Patient’s MediPurse .</p>
        <p>6 to 9 hours in advance</p>
        <p>Full refund + LKR 20 (≈ USD 0.10) credit to Patient’s MediPurse .</p>
        <p>3 to 6 hours in advance</p>
        <p>Full refund + LKR 30 (≈ USD 0.15) credit to Patient’s MediPurse .</p>
        <p>Less than 3 hours in advance, or No-show by Practitioner (missed appointment)**</p>
        <p>Full refund + LKR 50 (≈ USD 0.15) credit to Patient’s MediPurse .</p>
        <p>This means if a doctor cancels at the last minute, the patient not only gets their money back, but also a small additional credit as an apology for the inconvenience. The USD values are approximate conversions; the credit will be given in LKR for Sri Lankan users or equivalent local currency where applicable, based on Mediman’s policies. These credits are typically non-cashable and can be used for future bookings (see Section 7.7 below). Practitioners who cancel late may also face internal penalties per Mediman’s rules (e.g., loss of a portion of their fee or a mark on their reliability record), but any such penalty is handled between Mediman and the Practitioner (see also Section 11.2) and does not affect the Patient beyond the refund and credit described.</p>
        <p>If a Practitioner fails to show up for a scheduled consultation (a “no-show”), it will be treated as a cancellation less than 3 hours in advance, and the Patient will receive a full refund plus the LKR 50/USD 0.15 credit, as above. Mediman will assist the Patient in rescheduling with the same Practitioner (if appropriate and they become available) or with a different provider, as the Patient prefers.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.5 Rescheduling Policy: Rather than canceling outright, a Patient may opt to reschedule a confirmed booking to a different time with the same Practitioner (subject to the Practitioner’s availability). The Platform allows one reschedule per booking. A reschedule is essentially treated as a cancellation of the original slot with immediate rebooking to a new slot, but Mediman’s policy is to be more forgiving for rescheduling if done in advance. The following Appointment Rescheduling rules apply :</h3>
        <p>You can reschedule once per appointment (additional changes would require canceling and rebooking which might incur fees as above). If you reschedule more than 24 hours before the appointment start: it is free (no extra charge) . If rescheduled 12–24 hours before the appointment: you will be charged an extra fee equal to 50% of the Doctor’s fee for the appointment . (This covers part of the inconvenience and reserved time.) If rescheduled 6–12 hours before the appointment: you will be charged an extra fee equal to 25% of the Doctor’s fee . Rescheduling less than 6 hours before the appointment is not permitted . At that late stage, a change would be treated as a last-minute cancellation. If you cannot make the appointment with less than 6 hours to go, you should still cancel (the appointment will be a no-show if you don’t attend, which yields no refund as per 7.3) – either way, you will not be eligible for a refund of the fee.</p>
        <p>To reschedule, use the reschedule option on the Platform and select a new available time. The extra payment (if applicable) will be prompted at that time. If you attempt to reschedule when less than 6 hours remain, the system may prevent it; you would need to contact support for assistance, but as noted, such late changes are normally disallowed.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.6 Impact on Practitioners: When a Patient cancels or reschedules under these policies, the Practitioner’s entitlement to a fee may be adjusted accordingly. For example, if a Patient cancels 2 hours prior (no refund to patient), the Practitioner would ordinarily receive the fee (since the patient paid and got no refund), but Mediman may treat it as a completed appointment for payout or have internal rules for sharing some portion with Mediman due to operational costs. Conversely, if a Patient cancels 12 hours prior (50% refund to patient), the Practitioner will typically only receive the remaining 50% of the fee (less Mediman’s commission) for that booking. Details of how cancellations affect Practitioner earnings are provided in the Practitioner’s earning policies and dashboard (see Section 8.2 and 11.2) . Practitioners should note that “doctor-caused” cancellations or no-shows (their own cancellations) will result in no fee for that appointment and may incur penalties that fund the patient credits given (e.g., those LKR 10/20/30/50 credits are effectively deducted from what the Practitioner would have earned) . Mediman will clearly reflect such adjustments in the Practitioner’s earnings statements.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.7 Refund Processing and MediPurse Credits: When a Patient is entitled to a refund under the above policies, Mediman will first credit the refund amount to the Patient’s MediPurse (Patient) as an account credit . These MediPurse credits can be used for future bookings on Mediman and do not expire . By default, refunds are non-cashable credits, meaning you cannot immediately withdraw them as cash. If you prefer a cash refund (for example, back to your credit card or bank), you may request it, but please note: cash refunds are granted at Mediman’s discretion and may be subject to certain conditions or processing fees . In some jurisdictions or scenarios (such as if a refund is required by law or card network rules), Mediman will process a cash refund to the original payment method; otherwise, credits will be applied.</h3>
        <p>If you have a credit balance in MediPurse, it will automatically be applied to your next bookings unless you choose otherwise. Withdrawal requests of MediPurse (Patient) credit balances, if permitted, may take 2–4 weeks to process , as they involve additional verification and processing through payment gateways.</p>
        <p>Please also be aware that Mediman reserves the right to deduct nominal administrative or transaction processing fees from refunded amounts or credits, to cover the payment gateway charges or administrative overhead of cancellations . Any such fee (if applied) will be clearly communicated and in compliance with applicable laws.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.8 Practitioner No-Show or Late Arrival by Patient: If a Patient arrives late to an online session, the Practitioner will handle it per their policy (some may give the full slot time if possible, others may have to shorten due to other bookings). If the Patient is sufficiently late that the Practitioner deems it a no-show (typically if the Patient does not arrive at all or arrives so late that a meaningful consultation cannot occur in the remaining time), then the Patient No-show policy in section 7.3 (no refund) applies, and the Practitioner may be entitled to the fee. Practitioners, however, are encouraged to accommodate delays when possible to maintain goodwill, provided it doesn’t interfere with other scheduled consultations.</h3>
        <p>If a Practitioner is the one who is running late for a session (e.g., due to a previous appointment running over), they should inform the Patient via the Platform if possible. If the delay is significant (more than a few minutes) and the Patient cannot wait, the Patient may treat it as a Practitioner cancellation (if the Practitioner fails to start the session timely) and request a refund. Mediman will handle such situations case-by-case to ensure fairness (for example, if a Practitioner starts 10 minutes late but still provides the full consultation time and the Patient is willing, the session can proceed normally; if the Practitioner never arrived, it’s a no-show by Practitioner and Section 7.4 applies). 8. Fees, Payments, and Financial Terms</p>
        <p>This section describes how fees are set and charged on the Platform, how payments are processed, the responsibilities of Users regarding taxes, and how the Mediman wallet system (MediPurse) operates for both Patients and Practitioners. All monetary amounts are in the currency indicated (with LKR for Sri Lankan Rupees, USD for United States Dollars, or other local currency as applicable).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.1 Consultation Fees (Practitioners’ Pricing): Practitioners independently set their consultation fees for services offered through Mediman, subject to any minimum or maximum limits that may be imposed by Mediman or by law . Fees may vary based on the length or type of consultation (e.g., a 15-minute follow-up vs. a 30-minute new consultation) and can also differ by specialty or provider. In some jurisdictions, there may be country-specific caps or insurance payor rules that limit what can be charged; Practitioners must adhere to any such rules when setting their fees . Mediman may provide guidance or suggested fee ranges, but final pricing is at the Practitioner’s discretion (again, within legal and policy bounds). Practitioners also control their availability and schedule durations via the Platform . Mediman requires that for Patients located in certain countries, the pricing be displayed in the Patient’s local currency (“native-currency pricing”) to comply with local commerce rules . For example, consultations for Patients in Sri Lanka may be shown and charged in LKR, while those for Patients in other countries might be shown in USD or another relevant currency. In all cases, the applicable currency and amount will be clearly shown to the Patient at booking .</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.2 Platform Fees and Service Charges: Mediman sustains its operations by charging fees for the use of the Platform’s services. There are two main categories of fees that may apply: (a) a Platform or subscription fee charged to Practitioners, and (b) a transaction or convenience fee that might be passed to Patients or deducted from payments.</h3>
        <p>Practitioner Platform Fee: Mediman may charge Practitioners a commission or service fee as a percentage of each consultation fee, or a flat amount per consultation, as outlined in the Practitioner’s dashboard or a Schedule provided (formerly “Schedule A”) . This fee is typically automatically deducted from the Patient’s payment before the remainder is credited to the Practitioner’s MediPurse (see 8.4 below). Mediman will notify Practitioners of any changes to the fee structure with reasonable notice (for instance, via email or dashboard notification) . By continuing to use the Platform after such changes, Practitioners accept the updated fees. The Platform fee covers use of Mediman’s technology, support, and other facilitation services. Transaction/Processing Fees: Payments may involve third-party gateways, credit card processors, bank transfers, currency conversion (FX), and other services which have their own fees. Mediman will usually deduct these payment processing costs from the amounts received. For example, if a Patient pays $100 and the payment gateway charges 3%, $3 might be taken out to cover that fee before any split between Practitioner and Mediman . In some cases, a nominal transaction fee might be charged to the Patient at checkout to cover these costs (Mediman will display it if so). Platform facilitation fees (if any are charged to Patients) are typically non-refundable , meaning that if a consultation is refunded, that particular fee may not be returned, except where required by law. Visibility of Fees: Mediman strives for transparency. Patients will see the total price (inclusive of the Practitioner’s fee and any Platform or processing fees) before confirming a booking . Practitioners will see in their earnings reports the breakdown of their fees, Mediman’s commission, and net payout, and any other adjustments.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.3 Payments by Patients: Patients must pay for consultations at the time of booking (except in cases of an approved insurance or third-party billing integration, if available). The Platform supports various authorized payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, or the use of MediPurse credits. By inputting your payment information and confirming a booking, you authorize Mediman (or its payment processor) to charge the specified amount for the consultation fee and any applicable fees or taxes. All payments are processed through Mediman’s authorized payment gateways or through the MediPurse system . Mediman does not permit cash payments or direct payments to Practitioners outside the Platform for scheduled consultations (see anti-circumvention rules in Section 5.4). If a Patient’s payment is not successfully processed (e.g., card decline), the booking may be canceled or marked as unpaid, and the Patient will be prompted to provide a valid payment method to confirm the booking.</h3>
        <p>Mediman does not handle insurance claims or direct insurance billing unless explicitly stated (currently, Mediman is primarily a self-pay platform) . This means Patients are responsible for payment and, if they have insurance that might cover telehealth, they must seek reimbursement themselves. Mediman will provide receipts or invoices that include necessary details for Patients to submit claims to their insurers if they choose, but makes no guarantee that any service will be reimbursable by insurance .</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.4 Non-Refundable Fees: Certain fees on the Platform may be labeled as non-refundable, such as convenience fees, platform fees, or processing fees, as mentioned. Transaction and platform facilitation fees are non-refundable under any circumstances except where law mandates otherwise. For example, if a Patient pays a $5 Platform usage fee at booking and later gets a refund for the consultation, that $5 might not be returned. Mediman will clearly indicate which components of a charge are non-refundable. Practitioner commissions (the fee Mediman takes from the Practitioner) are generally not relevant to Patients, but if a consultation is refunded to a Patient, the Practitioner obviously does not receive their fee (or it is clawed back if already paid out), except as per any cancellation policy that provides partial retention.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.5 MediPurse Wallet System: The MediPurse is Mediman’s internal wallet system that tracks balances for users. There are two types:</h3>
        <p>MediPurse – Patient: This holds credits for Patients, typically from refunds or promotions. As described in Section 7.7, when a Patient gets a refund or credit, it goes into this wallet. The balance can be applied to future consultation bookings. It cannot be transferred to other users or externally, except through a withdrawal process if Mediman approves (which can take 2–4 weeks and may require KYC verification). Credits in the Patient MediPurse do not expire (unless a specific promotion states otherwise) . If a Patient account is terminated or deleted, any remaining MediPurse credits may be forfeited (see Section 14.3 and 14.4 on termination). MediPurse – Doctor (Practitioner): This holds the earnings for Practitioners. When a Practitioner completes a consultation and submits the required post-consultation documentation (clinical notes, etc.), the earnings are credited to the Practitioner’s MediPurse – Doctor balance . Essentially, this wallet accumulates the money the Practitioner has earned from consultations, after Mediman’s fees and any adjustments. It is not accessible outside the Platform until the Practitioner requests a payout (withdrawal).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.6 Payouts to Practitioners: Practitioners can withdraw the funds in their MediPurse – Doctor to their bank accounts via a payout request. Payout Requests can typically be made at any time after consultations are completed; however, Mediman may have a schedule (for example, allowing payouts weekly or at certain thresholds) . Currently, Mediman’s standard process is that payouts are processed on a weekly cycle on business days, and there may be a minimum payout threshold (e.g., a minimum amount that must be reached before a payout can be initiated) . Supported payout methods (such as bank transfer, cheque, or other payment processors) and any minimum thresholds are communicated in the Practitioner’s Dashboard . When a payout is executed, the designated amount will be transferred to the Practitioner’s nominated bank account or payment account on record. Practitioners are responsible for providing accurate payout details and updating them if they change; Mediman is not responsible for delays or losses due to incorrect banking information.</h3>
        <p>Mediman may deduct a Transaction Processing Fee from each payout to cover the cost of the transfer (or incorporate that into its commission). For instance, international transfers might incur a bank fee or currency conversion fee which will be passed on. Practitioners will see this noted in the payout details. Every rightful payout request, upon processing, will be remitted after deducting such fees as applicable.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.7 One-Time and Recurring Fees for Practitioners: Practitioners should be aware that Mediman may charge a one-time onboarding fee or a periodic platform maintenance fee. If such a fee applies, it will typically be deducted from the Practitioner’s first earnings or initial payouts . This fee might cover costs like verification, profile setup, or training materials provided. The amount of any such fee and its nature will be disclosed to Practitioners, either in these Terms (if fixed) or in the onboarding materials/Schedule A. For example, if there is a LKR 1,000 onboarding fee, and the Practitioner’s first consultation earns them LKR 5,000, Mediman might deduct LKR 1,000 and credit the net LKR 4,000 to MediPurse – Doctor. After the first time, generally no additional onboarding fee is taken. Recurring subscription fees (if any, e.g., for optional premium features) would be handled similarly or billed separately with notice.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.8 Taxes: Practitioners are responsible for determining and paying any taxes (income tax, service tax, VAT/GST, withholding tax, etc.) that apply to the fees they earn via Mediman . Mediman, as an intermediary, may in some cases be required by law to withhold a portion of earnings for tax purposes (for example, if a withholding tax on cross-border service payments applies). Where the law requires such withholding, Mediman is authorized to deduct the required amount and remit it to the taxing authorities on the Practitioner’s behalf , and will provide the Practitioner with documentation of the withholding. Practitioners should consult a tax advisor for guidance on reporting platform income. Mediman will provide annual summaries or invoices as needed to assist in tax filing.</h3>
        <p>For Patients, the displayed fees usually include any applicable taxes for the service (if any apply to telehealth consultations in your jurisdiction). If Mediman is required to collect any indirect taxes (like VAT) on the service fee, it will be included in the price you pay or shown separately. Patients are generally not responsible for any additional taxes beyond what is included in the purchase price, except possibly duties for cross-border services, which typically don’t apply to digital services.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.9 Anti-Fraud and Payment Security: Mediman takes payment security seriously. We may use third-party services to monitor for fraudulent transactions. Mediman reserves the right to withhold or freeze any payment (whether it’s a Patient’s payment in or a Practitioner’s payout) if we detect suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity . This hold may remain in place until we complete a verification process (e.g., confirming with the user or requesting additional identification). If we determine that a transaction was indeed unauthorized or fraudulent, we may cancel the booking and/or return funds to the rightful party. We also reserve the right to deactivate accounts involved in fraud. Furthermore, if a chargeback occurs (a Patient disputes a charge with their bank), Mediman will investigate. If the chargeback is resolved in the Patient’s favor, the Practitioner’s earnings for that consultation may be reversed (see Section 8.10).</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.10 Adjustments and Offsets: In certain circumstances, Mediman may need to adjust a Practitioner’s earnings or a Patient’s balance after a transaction. This could be due to a refund, chargeback, error, or breach of policy. Mediman reserves the right to withhold, offset, or deduct from a Practitioner’s future payouts any amounts that were paid out but are later subject to refund/chargeback, or that resulted from fraudulent or prohibited transactions . For example, if a Practitioner was paid for a consultation and afterward the Patient successfully disputed the charge due to non-receipt of service or fraud, Mediman may deduct that amount from the Practitioner’s MediPurse or next payout. Similarly, if a Practitioner violates the Terms and causes damage or fees (like legal penalties or excessive refund costs), Mediman may offset some of those costs against the Practitioner’s earnings, to the extent permitted by law and outlined in these Terms.</h3>
        <p>Mediman will provide notice to the Practitioner of any such adjustments and the reason, and will work in good faith to resolve any disagreements. Practitioners should note that their obligation to provide refunds to Patients in compliance with the cancellation policy, or in cases of substantiated service issues, may be enforced by Mediman by reversing transactions as needed.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8.11 Early Withdrawal Conditions (Practitioners): As an anti-fraud and stability measure, new Practitioners are subject to an early withdrawal policy. If you are a Practitioner who has been on the Platform for less than six (6) months since your registration approval, and you request a payout of your earnings, you must leave at least LKR 5,000 (or the equivalent in other currency, roughly USD ~$15 depending on exchange rates) in your MediPurse – Doctor after the payout . This means your withdrawal request cannot bring your balance below LKR 5,000 within the first 6 months. For example, if you have LKR 10,000 in earnings and are in your third month, you could withdraw up to LKR 5,000, leaving 5,000 in the wallet. This retained amount helps cover any potential chargebacks or issues from your early transactions. After 6 months of good standing on the platform (and assuming no pending disputes), this restriction is lifted and you may withdraw down to zero balance (subject to any minimum transfer limits). Mediman may waive or modify this requirement on a case-by-case basis (e.g., for a Practitioner who has completed a large number of consultations with no issues in a shorter time). 9. Privacy & Data Protection</h3>
        <p>Mediman is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Users’ personal data, including health information. This section outlines how personal data is handled on the Platform, the obligations of different parties under privacy laws, and Users’ rights regarding their data. Use of the Platform is also subject to our detailed Privacy Policy (available on our website), which provides more specifics on data handling.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.1 Compliance with Privacy Laws: Mediman will process personal data in compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including the Sri Lanka Personal Data Protection Act, as well as internationally recognized standards such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and, where applicable, the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) . Although Mediman is based in Sri Lanka, we strive to implement GDPR-equivalent principles for all users, meaning we value transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, security, and respect for user rights in all jurisdictions . For Users in the United States, while Mediman itself is not a “covered entity” under HIPAA, we endeavor to apply HIPAA-aligned safeguards to any protected health information managed through our Platform . Practitioners using the Platform may be considered “covered health care providers” when they provide telehealth services and thus may have independent obligations under laws like HIPAA – it is the Practitioner’s responsibility to comply, and Mediman provides a secure environment to support that compliance.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.2 Roles of Mediman and Practitioner (Data Controller/Processor): The distinction of roles under privacy law can vary by jurisdiction. Generally, Mediman acts as a “data processor” or service provider for much of the personal and health information on behalf of Practitioners and Patients – facilitating communications and storage of records as per user instructions . Mediman collects certain data directly from Users for account setup and Platform operation (acting as a controller for that data, e.g., your email used for login). Practitioners may be considered independent data controllers (or “covered entities”) for the medical information they collect and generate in the course of consultations . For example, a doctor’s consultation notes and diagnoses might be viewed legally as part of that doctor’s medical records for the patient. Practitioners must handle such data in accordance with their professional record-keeping and privacy obligations, including retention for mandated periods, providing copies to patients or authorities as required by law, and deleting or anonymizing data when no longer needed and when allowed by law . Mediman will assist by providing access to records stored on the Platform to the extent needed (for instance, a Practitioner can download consultation notes). Mediman’s role is to process and store data on behalf of users and it does not use personal health data for any purpose outside of providing and improving the service (unless explicitly permitted by the user, such as for participating in research or surveys, in which separate consent would be obtained).</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.3 Patient Confidentiality (Practitioner Obligations): Practitioners must treat all patient information obtained through the Platform as strictly confidential, in accordance with medical ethics and privacy laws . This includes any personal details, health history, images, or records. Except as required for providing care to the patient or as legally required (e.g., mandatory disease reporting, or if compelled by a court order), Practitioners should not disclose patient information to any third party without the patient’s consent. Practitioners should also avoid storing patient information outside the Platform unless necessary for compliance with laws (for instance, keeping a copy of records if required by local law) . If a Practitioner does export or save any patient data offline, they assume the responsibility to secure it (e.g., storing in a locked file or encrypted drive) and eventually properly dispose of it per retention guidelines.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.4 Data Security Measures: Mediman employs administrative, physical, and technical security measures to protect personal data. This includes encryption of data at rest and in transit, secure servers, access controls, and regular security audits. However, Users also play a crucial role in data security. All Users should use the Platform in a private setting where unauthorized persons cannot overhear or see sensitive information . For example, when engaging in a video consultation, ensure you are in a private room. Practitioners should use headsets if in a shared environment to prevent others from hearing patient information. Both Patients and Practitioners should use updated devices and software with appropriate antivirus/malware protection . Do not use public computers or unsecured public Wi-Fi to access the Platform without using a secure connection (VPN or similar), especially when sensitive data is involved. Practitioners specifically should not download or transfer PHI to personal apps or devices that are not secure or not necessary for care . If you suspect any security incident or data breach (like unauthorized access to your account or any loss/theft of devices containing Mediman data), you must notify Mediman without undue delay so we can assist in securing the account and comply with any breach notification requirements .</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.5 Use of Personal Data by Mediman: Mediman will use your personal data only for legitimate purposes related to providing our services and as described in our Privacy Policy . The typical purposes include:</h3>
        <p>Account creation and authentication: We use your registration info to set up your account, verify your identity (especially for Practitioners, where we may verify licenses), and allow you to log in securely . Service delivery: To facilitate bookings, consultations (routing communications between Patient and Practitioner), prescription processing, and sending you notifications about your appointments . Payment processing: We process payment details to handle consultation fees and payouts, and generate invoices or receipts for your transactions . Platform improvement and analytics: We may use usage data and feedback to improve Platform functionality, develop new features, and perform data analytics. Wherever possible, we use aggregated or anonymized data for these purposes so it is not linked to an identifiable person . Customer support: If you contact us for help, we will access relevant data to assist you (for example, looking at your last appointment if you had an issue with it). Legal and compliance: We might process data as needed to comply with legal obligations (e.g., keeping records of transactions for financial regulations, or cooperating with lawful requests such as subpoenas) , and to enforce these Terms or investigate fraud and security issues.</p>
        <p>We will not sell or rent your personal data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent . We do not engage in advertising schemes that use your health data. We may share data with third-party service providers under contract (such as cloud hosting, payment processors, analytics tools) only as needed for them to perform their services on our behalf, and they are obligated to protect it and use it only for those purposes.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.6 Cross-Border Data Transfers: Given that Mediman serves users globally and uses cloud infrastructure, your data may be stored or processed on servers located in various countries. Primarily, data will be stored in data centers with robust security (the location may be disclosed in the Privacy Policy; for example, servers in Singapore or the EU). If you are in a jurisdiction with data export restrictions (like the EU), we ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or other GDPR-compliant transfer mechanisms) are in place to lawfully transfer data internationally. By using the Platform, you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to and stored in countries outside your own, which may have different data protection standards, but Mediman will ensure protection consistent with the principles outlined here.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.7 User Rights – Access, Correction, Deletion: You have rights regarding your personal data. Subject to applicable law, these may include:</h3>
        <p>Access: You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you (this could include your profile information, consultation history, etc.). Practitioners can access and download their consultation notes and related patient records from the Platform. Patients can access their own consultation summaries and any files or prescriptions provided. Correction: If any of your data is inaccurate or outdated, you can correct it by editing your profile or contacting support for assistance. It’s crucial that names, contact information, and health information be kept accurate. Deletion (Right to Erasure): You may request deletion of your personal data. You can do some of this by deleting your account (see Termination section for implications). Upon verified request to delete data, Mediman will erase or anonymize your personal data to the extent required by law and feasible for service operations . Please note: There are certain data that we may need to retain even after an erasure request, due to legal obligations – for example, transaction records for financial auditing, or medical records that a Practitioner is required by law to retain for a minimum period, or logs required for security and fraud prevention. However, we will comply with GDPR Article 17 and similar regulations by removing data that is no longer necessary . Once your account is deleted, your personal information will be scrubbed from active databases, and remaining data may be kept in an anonymized form. Objection and Restriction: You might have the right to object to or restrict certain processing (for instance, you can opt-out of non-essential data uses like marketing emails, and we will honor that). Data Portability: We can provide your data in a commonly used electronic format if you need it to port to another service (this could include an export of your consultation history or profile info).</p>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at support@mediman.life . We will verify your identity (to protect privacy) and respond within the timeframe required by law (typically within 30 days for GDPR, etc.). There is generally no cost for this unless requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (in which case a reasonable fee might be charged or the request refused, as allowed by law).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.8 Privacy of Communications: Mediman’s Platform may provide text chat or messaging features between Patients and Practitioners (for example, to clarify minor follow-up questions or share updates). These communications are part of the medical record and are private between you and your healthcare provider, though Mediman’s systems store them. Mediman staff will not access these communications unless necessary for support (e.g., resolving a user complaint) or required by law. Recording of video consultations is generally not done by Mediman (and as per Conduct rules, Users should not record without consent). If Mediman ever introduces a recording feature for quality or record-keeping, it will be clearly disclosed and consent obtained.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.9 Data Retention: Mediman retains personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes it was collected for, including any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. For example:</h3>
        <p>Basic account information may be kept until account deletion (and some elements even after, as noted). Consultation records might be kept for a certain number of years as needed for practitioners to meet legal retention periods (this can vary by country, often 5-10 years). Log data and backups might be retained briefly then cycled out, or longer if needed for security audits.</p>
        <p>We anonymize or securely destroy data when it’s no longer needed. Practitioners should download and securely store any records they are obliged to keep beyond our retention, as Mediman cannot guarantee to hold data indefinitely.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9.10 Confidentiality of Business Information: In using the Platform, you might have access to certain non-public information, such as when Practitioners see platform usage tips or fee schedules, or Patients see certain internal pricing breakdowns. While not exactly personal data, all users agree to keep confidential any non-public information of Mediman that is disclosed to them, except as required to be disclosed by law. See also Section 12 (Intellectual Property) for data and content ownership aspects.</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to our full Privacy Policy or contact our Data Protection Officer (if applicable) at the contact information provided in Section 19. 10. Compliance, Monitoring & Regulatory Matters</p>
        <p>Mediman and its users must comply with a variety of healthcare regulations, professional standards, and other legal requirements. This section outlines expectations and obligations to ensure that both Practitioners and Patients use the Platform in a legally compliant manner. It also covers Mediman’s rights to monitor compliance and take action where necessary.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.1 Compliance with Healthcare Laws: All Users agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations when using Mediman. This includes, but is not limited to:</h3>
        <p>Telemedicine and Medical Practice Laws: Practitioners must follow the telehealth laws of their jurisdiction and the Patient’s jurisdiction (if different). This means abiding by any licensure requirements (e.g., you may need to be licensed in the state/country where the patient is located if required by law), standards of care for telemedicine, and limitations on prescribing via telehealth (such as restrictions on prescribing controlled substances without an in-person exam, if such laws exist). Practitioners should also follow any guidelines issued by medical councils or boards for telehealth practice. Healthcare Advertising & Inducements: Practitioners must adhere to rules on advertising and patient solicitation . This means, for example, no guaranteeing cures, no offering unapproved treatments, and no providing incentives to patients that violate medical ethics or law (like giving a patient a gift in exchange for using the service, beyond what’s allowed). Any testimonials or reviews displayed must comply with local advertising rules (some jurisdictions forbid using patient testimonials in advertising medical services – Mediman’s review system is user-generated content, but Practitioners should not misuse it in their own promotions) . Pharmacy and Prescription Regulations: If a prescription is provided through the Platform, it must comply with pharmacy laws. For instance, some medications may not legally be prescribed via telehealth or across borders. Practitioners should only prescribe in accordance with what their license and local regulations permit. Consent and Consumer Protection: Practitioners should ensure informed consent is obtained (see Section 6). Mediman as a service will comply with any consumer protection laws (e.g., providing required disclosures, honoring cooling-off periods if applicable, etc.). Cross-Border Services: For international users, Mediman endeavors to adhere to applicable cross-border e-commerce and telehealth regulations . This means if there are specific legal requirements for offering telehealth across certain country lines, we aim to meet them. Users are also responsible for ensuring that using Mediman is legal in their location. If you are in a region that forbids receiving telehealth from foreign doctors, you should not use the Platform in that manner. Mediman may restrict or block services in certain jurisdictions if required.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.2 Audits and Quality Monitoring: To maintain a high standard of service and ensure compliance with these Terms and legal obligations, Mediman reserves the right to conduct audits or reviews of user activities on the Platform . For Practitioners, this can include verifying that your license remains in good standing, reviewing consultation records or communications (with respect for privacy, and only as needed) if a complaint arises, and monitoring prescription patterns for red flags (like unusually high volumes of controlled substances). Mediman may also audit content you post (e.g. educational content or profiles) for accuracy and compliance. You agree to cooperate reasonably with any Mediman-initiated audit . Failure to cooperate or to promptly provide information (like proof of license renewal) can result in suspension. These audits are intended to protect patients and ensure trust in the platform.</h3>
        <p>Additionally, Mediman may use automated tools to scan for certain violations (for example, our system might flag if a Practitioner attempts to share a personal phone number in the chat, or if a chat message contains harassing language). Mediman may intervene or issue warnings based on these detections.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.3 Sanctions, Export Controls, and AML: By using Mediman, you represent and warrant that you are not on any prohibited or sanctioned party lists (such as lists maintained by the United Nations, U.S. Treasury (OFAC), EU, etc.) . Mediman must comply with international sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) laws. We perform screening of users against relevant sanctions lists and may ask for additional identity verification to ensure compliance (this is part of KYC as mentioned in Section 3.3). If you are identified as a sanctioned individual or if your use of the Platform would violate export control or sanctions laws (e.g., providing services to a sanctioned country), Mediman will suspend or terminate your access . Funds associated with sanctioned individuals may be frozen as required by law. You also confirm that the funds you use on the Platform (for Patients, the money you pay; for Practitioners, the money you withdraw) are from legitimate sources and not the proceeds of crime or fraud . Mediman may report suspicious transactions to relevant authorities in accordance with AML laws.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.4 Reporting Obligations (Practitioners): Practitioners have certain professional and legal obligations that carry over into telehealth. If you become aware of any adverse patient outcome or safety issue related to a consultation on Mediman (for example, if a patient reports a serious side effect or hospitalization that might relate to a prescription you gave), you should follow normal incident reporting protocols, such as notifying regulatory bodies if required. Additionally, if you suspect that there has been any data breach or privacy incident involving patient information on Mediman (for instance, you accidentally shared one patient’s info with another, or you suspect your account was compromised), you must inform Mediman without undue delay . Timely reporting allows us to address the issue quickly and fulfill any legal obligations (like notifying affected individuals or authorities under data protection laws). Mediman will treat such reports with urgency and coordinate any response.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.5 Mediman’s Compliance Actions: If Mediman believes that a User’s conduct may violate a law or regulation, or if we receive a law enforcement request or court order, we may take action including providing information to authorities as legally required, or suspending the user in question. For example, if a Practitioner is accused of malpractice or unlicensed activity, we may suspend their account pending investigation. If a Patient is found misusing prescriptions (e.g., prescription fraud or diversion), we may report it and suspend the account.</h3>
        <p>Mediman may also implement country-specific compliance measures. For instance, if a particular country enacts a rule that telemedicine providers must register or display a compliance seal, we will work to incorporate that.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.6 International Regulatory Adherence: Mediman is proactive in keeping up with telehealth regulations in different regions. We may update our Terms and policies as laws change (see Section 15 about modifications) to ensure ongoing compliance. Your continued use means you agree to any new compliance requirements (for example, if we introduce two-factor authentication to comply with EU regulations on security, you would need to follow that).</h3>
        <p>In summary, compliance is a shared responsibility: Mediman provides a compliant platform and guidelines, Practitioners must adhere to professional and legal standards, and Patients must use the service lawfully. If you ever have concerns about legality or encounter an issue, please contact Mediman support or, if appropriate, seek legal counsel for guidance. 11. Intellectual Property Rights</p>
        <p>This section describes the ownership and permitted use of intellectual property related to the Mediman Platform, as well as the handling of content created by Users (both Patients and Practitioners). By using the Platform, you agree to respect these intellectual property provisions.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.1 Mediman Platform IP: The Platform (including the website, mobile app, and all underlying software, databases, and infrastructure) and all content provided by Mediman (such as the overall design, logos, trademarks, graphics, button icons, and text not created by users) are the exclusive property of Mediman Life (Pvt) Ltd . This includes our trademarks and service marks (e.g., “Mediman” name and logo), the user interface design, the compilation of content, and the software code. These are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, create derivative works from, or publicly display any part of Mediman’s platform or content without our prior written consent . For clarity, this means you cannot scrape our website to create a competing service, cannot use our brand name in a confusing way, and cannot reverse-engineer our app to build something similar. You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for its intended purpose (personal healthcare or professional practice) – but this does not give you ownership of any portion of the Platform.</h3>
        <p>If you want to reference Mediman in media or research, you should adhere to our guidelines and only use our logos with permission and proper attribution. Practitioners listing their services on the Platform are allowed to mention that fact and even use the Mediman name to describe their use (e.g., “Available on Mediman”), but not in any way that implies employment by or partnership with Mediman beyond the marketplace relationship.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.2 User-Generated Content Ownership: Mediman does not claim ownership of the content that Users (Patients or Practitioners) provide, post, input, or submit to the Platform as part of using the services, except for the license mentioned below. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in content you upload or create on the Platform. This includes, for example:</h3>
        <p>Practitioner Content: Your profile picture and biography, any educational articles or health tips you write and share via the Platform (such as MedTalks), and your consultation notes or medical records you produce during a consultation . These remain your intellectual property (or if you are employed by a clinic that owns them, then they remain that clinic’s property). Patient Content: Any information or documents you upload (like medical history, test results), and any reviews or feedback you post.</p>
        <p>By submitting or posting content on the Platform, you grant Mediman a license to use that content as needed to provide and promote the services . Specifically, for private medical content (like consultation records), you grant Mediman the rights to store, process, and transmit that content to the Practitioner or to you, as well as to back it up and retain it per policy – essentially acting as a custodian and processor of it . Mediman will not disclose private consultation content to other users or third parties except as allowed by these Terms (see Privacy and Compliance sections) – so this license is primarily for operating the service.</p>
        <p>For public or shared content (like a Practitioner’s educational article, or a Patient’s review of a doctor), you give Mediman a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works from that content on our Platform and in our marketing or social media (for example, showcasing a great answer a doctor provided in a Q&A section, or quoting a positive user testimonial) . This license lasts until you remove the content from the Platform, except that if we have already used it in marketing collateral, we may not be able to retract it, but we will cease new uses after removal. Do not post any content that you do not have the right to share or license in this manner.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.3 Protected Health Information: As noted, while you retain ownership of your personal health data, when it comes to PHI or medical records, both Practitioners and Patients should understand these are sensitive and protected. Mediman provides necessary rights to Practitioners to access and use patient data for treatment and record-keeping. Patients have rights to their own data. Outside of those uses, PHI is not to be used for other purposes. For instance, a Practitioner cannot take a patient’s photo or case details from Mediman and post them publicly or use them in research without proper consent and anonymization.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.4 Feedback: If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback to Mediman about how to improve the Platform or new features (“Feedback”), note that Mediman may use such Feedback without any obligation to you. You hereby license any such Feedback to Mediman to use freely. This is so we don’t have to treat suggestions as confidential or face IP issues if we implement something similar to what a user suggests.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.5 Prohibited IP Uses: In using the Platform, you agree not to:</h3>
        <p>Use any of Mediman’s trademarks in a way that could cause confusion about whether any product or service is endorsed or provided by Mediman when it is not. Remove or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices on the Platform. Engage in scraping or data mining of the Platform, which is explicitly prohibited. Automated scripts or bots collecting data or content from Mediman could violate not just these terms but also data protection laws (due to PHI exposure). Reproduce the Platform’s functionality. For example, you cannot take the video consultation module and incorporate it into another app, or use knowledge of our system to build a competitor using our trade secrets. Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software or features of the Platform, except to the extent allowed by law for interoperability (and if you intend that, you must notify us and give us a chance to provide needed info first, per many jurisdictions’ rules).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.6 Third-Party IP: The Platform may contain content or software from third parties (for example, a video codec licensed for our use, or a third-party’s branding if we integrate a service). All rights in third-party content or software remain with their respective owners. Users must also respect those rights. For example, if a Practitioner shares a PDF pamphlet from a pharmaceutical company through the Platform, the pharma company’s copyright still applies to that pamphlet.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.7 Intellectual Property Infringement: We respect intellectual property rights and ask Users to do the same. If you believe that any content on Mediman infringes your copyright or other IP rights (for instance, someone posted your copyrighted article without permission), you should send us a notice of infringement at the contact provided in Section 19. We will respond according to applicable IP laws (such as the DMCA for U.S. copyright issues), which may include removing or disabling access to the infringing content and terminating accounts of repeat infringers. Practitioners should be careful only to upload content (images, documents) that they have rights to use or that are license-free, especially in public areas.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.8 Reservation of Rights: All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by Mediman. Users are not granted any implied licenses. Misuse of Mediman’s IP or violating these IP terms can result in suspension or termination of your account and possible legal action.</h3>
        <p>In summary, Mediman owns the platform; you own your personal content; each party gives the other the needed licenses to use what they provide for the intended purposes; and everyone must respect copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">12. Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability, and Indemnity</h2>
        <p>This section contains important disclaimers of warranties, limitations on the liability of Mediman, and obligations of Users to indemnify (protect) Mediman in certain situations. Please read this section carefully as it affects your legal rights.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.1 “As-Is” Service Disclaimer: Mediman provides the Platform and all services “as is” and “as available”, without any warranties or guarantees of any kind, either express or implied . While we strive to provide a reliable and high-quality service, we do not guarantee that the Platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet all of your expectations . Use of the Platform is at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Mediman and its affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, and agents, disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that: (a) telehealth consultations will yield any specific medical outcome; (b) information (whether from Practitioners or content on the site) is accurate, complete or up-to-date at all times (though we endeavor to ensure quality); (c) the Platform will be free from viruses or security breaches; or (d) errors or defects in the Platform will be corrected immediately. No advice or information obtained from Mediman or through the Platform shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.2 No Liability for Certain Acts: Mediman is not liable for the following types of issues or damages under any circumstances, to the maximum extent permitted by law :</h3>
        <p>Indirect or Consequential Damages: This includes any incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, or damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform . For example, if there’s a technical issue and you are unable to complete a consultation that leads to some harm or cost, or if you rely on the Platform and it has an outage causing inconvenience, we are not liable for those indirect consequences. Medical Services and Outcomes: All healthcare services accessed through Mediman are provided by independent Practitioners. Mediman is not responsible for the quality or appropriateness of the medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or other services that a Practitioner provides . Any misdiagnosis, medical negligence, or adverse outcome is a matter between the Patient and the Practitioner (subject to malpractice laws and the Practitioner’s liability), and not the responsibility of Mediman . Mediman does not practice medicine and does not have liability for medical malpractice of providers on the Platform . User Conduct: Mediman is not liable for the conduct of Users on the Platform. This means we are not responsible if a Patient or Practitioner behaves inappropriately, or if a Patient provides false information and that leads to harm, or if a Practitioner fails to adhere to standards outside of our control. While we try to credential Practitioners, we cannot guarantee every interaction. Technical Failures: We are not responsible for any problems or technical malfunctions of any telephone network or lines, computer online systems, servers or providers, software, failure of email, video, or browsers, or on account of technical problems or traffic congestion on the internet or any website, or any combination thereof, including injury or damage to users or to any person’s computer, equipment, or mobile device related to or resulting from using our Platform . If your consultation is disrupted due to connectivity issues, device issues, or Platform bugs, we regret the inconvenience and will try to help reschedule, but we are not financially liable for any impact of that disruption. Third-Party Services: If the Platform integrates or links to any third-party services (like a pharmacy, lab, or payment provider), Mediman isn’t responsible for those third parties. For instance, if a prescription is sent to a pharmacy and there’s an error on the pharmacy’s end, or if a payment gateway has a security breach, we will assist in resolution as possible, but we aren’t liable for their actions. Loss of Data: While we take precautions to safeguard data, any loss of data that occurs (for example, due to a server failure) and any costs to recover or re-enter data are not our liability, except to the extent required by law.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.3 Limitation of Liability Cap: To the extent that, despite the above disclaimers, Mediman is found liable to you for any claim arising out of or related to the use of the Platform or these Terms, our aggregate liability to any User (whether a Patient or a Practitioner) will be limited to the lesser of: (a) the total amount of fees you paid to Mediman in the 6 months prior to the event giving rise to the liability; or (b) USD $100 (or equivalent in local currency), unless a different amount is prescribed by applicable law .</h3>
        <p>For Patients: since Mediman generally collects fees on behalf of Practitioners and only a small portion might be Mediman’s, as a practical matter, the amount Mediman directly receives (platform fees) in relation to your usage in the last 6 months is typically low. But in no case will our total liability exceed what you paid for the specific consultation or service that gave rise to your claim . For example, if you paid $50 for a consultation that you claim caused harm, Mediman’s liability (if any) would not exceed $50 for that claim.</p>
        <p>For Practitioners: since you pay Mediman in the form of a commission or subscription, not the other way around, our liability cap will consider the fees you paid to us (not the fees you earned from patients). If, for instance, you paid Mediman $200 in platform fees over the last 6 months, that would be the cap . If you didn’t pay any fees (because we deducted commissions rather than charging you externally), then arguably our cap is very minimal or $0 (but for fairness we would default to $100 or equivalent, whichever is lower, as stated).</p>
        <p>These limitations apply to any and all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for personal injuries or for intentional misconduct or gross negligence, so some of these limitations may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.4 Emergency and Healthcare Disclaimer: Further emphasizing: Mediman is not an emergency service. We disclaim any liability for outcomes where the Platform is used in lieu of emergency care. If you attempt to use Mediman when you should have sought emergency help, you do so against our recommendations (see Section 2.4), and we will not be responsible for any resulting harm.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.5 Indemnification: You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Mediman, its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim or proceeding based on: (a) your use of the Platform or services in violation of these Terms or applicable law; (b) your breach of any provision of these Terms (including any of the representations or warranties you make herein); (c) your violation of any law or regulation (e.g., a Practitioner’s violation of medical licensing laws or a Patient’s violation of drug prescription laws); (d) your negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct; or (e) for Practitioners, the content you provide or actions you take in the course of providing medical consultations (including any claim of malpractice, improper treatment, or infringement of rights via content shared) .</h3>
        <p>This means if someone else (not you) sues Mediman because of something you did, you will step in to defend Mediman (with counsel reasonably acceptable to us) and/or pay for the costs of defense and any damages. For example:</p>
        <p>If you are a Practitioner and a patient sues both you and Mediman alleging injury from your medical advice, you agree to indemnify Mediman for all costs and liabilities (since that claim arises from your provision of medical services) . If you are a Patient and you misuse the Platform or violate the Terms (say you secretly record a session and post it publicly, and the Practitioner sues Mediman for breach of privacy), you would indemnify us. If any content you post (like a review or article) infringes someone’s IP and they bring a claim against Mediman, you indemnify us.</p>
        <p>Mediman will promptly notify you of any such claim and allow you to assume the defense (with our cooperation). We reserve the right to participate in the defense with our own counsel (at our own expense) and to approve any settlement that would admit liability or impose obligations on us.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.6 Limitations in Consumer Cases: If you are using the Platform as a consumer (not as a business/professional), certain limitations or exclusions above may not fully apply to you, especially in jurisdictions that disallow them. For example, in some places consumer protection law might not allow a broad indemnity or may imply certain warranties. We do not seek to override those laws – in such cases, our liability and warranty are limited to the maximum extent permitted by those laws.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.7 Release: To the extent permitted by law, you release Mediman and the Indemnified Parties from claims or liability related to any content posted on the Platform by other users, or the conduct of other users. This is a general release; if you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542 (which says a general release does not extend to claims you don’t know about), and similar principles elsewhere.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12.8 Essential Basis: You acknowledge that Mediman has set its prices and offered access to the Platform in reliance on the disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth in these Terms, and that those form an essential basis of the bargain between you and us. Absent such disclaimers and limitations, these terms or the fees charged would be different.</h3>
        <p>This section survives any termination of your account or these Terms. 13. Term, Termination, Suspension, and Survival</p>
        <p>This section explains how long the agreement lasts, and the conditions under which either you or Mediman can terminate or suspend the account/contract, as well as what provisions remain effective after termination.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13.1 Term of Agreement: This Agreement shall commence on the date you first accept it (by creating an account or otherwise indicating your acceptance) and will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with this Section . There is no fixed end-date; it continues as long as you use the Platform.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13.2 Termination or Suspension by Mediman: Mediman may, at its discretion, suspend your access to the Platform or terminate this Agreement (and your account) immediately at any time by providing notice (which may be an email or in-app notification), for any reason, including but not limited to the following :</h3>
        <p>Breach of Terms: If you violate any provision of these Terms or any other policy incorporated herein. For example, if you engage in prohibited conduct (Section 5) or fail to comply with Practitioners’ eligibility requirements. Fraud or Misuse: If we detect fraudulent activity or misuse of the Platform (e.g. using fake identities, attempting to game the payment system, etc.). Quality or Safety Concerns (Practitioners): If a Practitioner receives consistently poor ratings, substantiated complaints, has a serious incident (like providing dangerous misinformation), or otherwise fails to meet quality standards or cooperation (like refusal of an audit), we may suspend or remove them . Legal Risk or Compliance: If your use of the Platform poses legal risk to Mediman (for instance, a regulatory authority demands we cease providing services to you or in your region, or you are involved in litigation that implicates the Platform), or if you are found not to meet compliance requirements (e.g., a practitioner loses their license, or a patient is found under sanctions) . Inactive Accounts: We reserve the right to deactivate accounts that have been inactive for an extended period (e.g., 2 years), after reaching out via your registered email. Non-Payment: For any services or fees that you owe to Mediman (if applicable, e.g., a subscription fee for Practitioners) and fail to pay after notice.</p>
        <p>Suspension might mean temporary disabling of your account (preventing log-in or preventing certain actions, like booking or consulting). Termination means permanent closure of your account.</p>
        <p>When feasible, Mediman will attempt to give prior notice of termination or suspension along with the reason, but we are not obligated to do so if immediate action is necessary (for example, in cases of serious misconduct or security issues).</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13.3 Termination by You (Account Deletion): You have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time by deactivating or deleting your account through the Platform’s settings or by contacting us .</h3>
        <p>Deactivation (Soft Delete): Practitioners may have an option to temporarily deactivate their account, which hides their profile and availability but keeps data intact for potential reactivation. This is useful if you want to take a break but potentially return. During deactivation, you won’t be able to accept new bookings. Permanent Deletion: You can choose to permanently delete your account. We will process this promptly (with certain verification steps to confirm it’s you making the request). Account deletion is irreversible  . You will lose access to all data associated with the account, including appointment history, messages, and any MediPurse balance (Patient credits or unpaid Practitioner earnings) if not withdrawn prior to deletion . Once deleted, you cannot recover the account or data.</p>
        <p>For Patients: if you delete your account, any upcoming appointments will be canceled (with refunds per policy if applicable) and you will no longer be able to view your past consultation records on the Platform, so you might want to download any important records before deletion.</p>
        <p>For Practitioners: if you have upcoming appointments at time of deletion, we ask that you cancel them and inform patients appropriately (or our support will help manage it) as part of professional courtesy. Additionally, if you have a MediPurse balance, request payout before deletion. Deleting an account with pending earnings might forfeit those earnings unless you contact support.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13.4 Effect of Termination; Surviving Provisions: Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason:</h3>
        <p>Your right to access or use the Platform ceases immediately. You must stop using the Platform and no longer represent in any way that you are affiliated with Mediman. We may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all associated data and files, or we may retain certain data as outlined below. You will not be able to recover your content or information once your account is deleted (with the exception of data you are entitled to as a patient from the practitioner’s records, which you would need to request from the practitioner or possibly Mediman if law permits). Any provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall continue to be in effect. This includes, without limitation: Section 9 (Privacy & Data Protection) to the extent of our ongoing obligations, Section 11 (Intellectual Property), Section 12 (Disclaimers & Liability), this Section 13.4, Section 15 (Dispute Resolution & Governing Law), and Section 16 (General Provisions). Additionally, any outstanding payment obligations you have (like if money is owed or if chargebacks occur after termination) remain due. Mediman may retain certain information as required by law or legitimate business purposes . For example, we generally retain invoicing records, proof of services, and certain communications for audit and compliance. Medical records of consultations might be retained to fulfill legal medical record retention requirements; however, after account deletion, these would typically only be accessible to the Practitioner and the patient (upon request) and not through the normal user interface. Also, data needed for dispute resolution or fraud prevention may be kept. If your account was terminated by Mediman due to breach or misconduct, you may not create a new account or access the Platform without our prior written permission. Mediman may also notify relevant authorities or other affected parties of your breach if appropriate (for example, if a practitioner was terminated for malpractice or loss of license, we might inform patients who had future appointments, etc., in a professional manner).</p>
        <p>Termination of the agreement does not waive any liability or responsibility you may have incurred prior to termination. For instance, if a legal claim arises from events during your time using the Platform, both you and Mediman can still enforce rights or claims as appropriate after termination.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13.5 Continuity of Care (Practitioners): If a Practitioner’s account is terminated (whether by them or by Mediman), Practitioners should be mindful of their ethical obligation to their patients. If you had ongoing care plans or need to transfer care, try to ensure patients are notified and have resources to find alternative care. Mediman may, if appropriate and feasible, provide patients who had recent consultations with a terminated practitioner with a list of other providers in that specialty, or otherwise assist in continuity, but this is not an assumption of care, just a courtesy.</h3>
        <p>This section ensures clarity that ending the platform relationship doesn’t necessarily end certain responsibilities and that both parties have rights to end the relationship under certain conditions. 14. Changes to Terms</p>
        <p>Mediman may update or modify these Terms in the future as our business and legal requirements evolve. This section describes how we will handle changes and what rights you have in that process.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.1 Right to Modify: We reserve the right to amend, revise, or update these Terms & Conditions at any time . We may do so to reflect changes in our services, accommodate new features, address changes in law, or for any other operational reasons.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.2 Notice of Changes: If we make material changes to these Terms, we will provide notice to Users in a manner reasonably designed to inform you of the change. This may include:</h3>
        <p>Posting the updated Terms on our website or app (we always indicate the “Effective Date” at the top so you can see if it changed). Sending an email to the address associated with your account. Adding a prominent notification in your user dashboard or upon login .</p>
        <p>For less significant changes (like clarifications or typo corrections that do not substantially affect your rights), we may just update the Terms online without a direct notice, but the “Effective Date” will change.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.3 Acceptance of Changes: The updated Terms will become effective on the date specified in the notice or when posted (the “Effective Date”). If you continue to use the Platform after the Effective Date, that constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms . If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using the Platform and may delete your account.</h3>
        <p>We generally try to give advance notice (for example, 15 days or 30 days) for significant changes, especially those that might be negative for users. However, certain changes might need to be implemented faster (for example, addressing an urgent legal change). When possible, we’ll provide a grace period for you to review and agree to the new Terms.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.4 Negotiated Changes: In some cases (such as enterprise deals or partnerships), separate negotiated terms might exist. Those will usually include their own amendment clauses.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.5 Continued Availability: We will keep an accessible version of the most current Terms on our website (often via a “Terms & Conditions” link). We might also archive past versions for reference. It’s your responsibility to review any new Terms when we notify you of them. If you have questions about any change, you can contact support for clarification.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.6 Other Policies: Changes to other policies (like our Privacy Policy or specific guidelines) may be handled similarly. We might update those and notify you as appropriate. Sometimes, we may bundle multiple updates together in one notice.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14.7 No Oral Modifications: Any changes to these Terms must be made in writing by us (either via the official posted update or a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of Mediman). No oral statements by our employees or support staff can amend these Terms.</h3>
        <p>In summary, we will not surprise you with hidden changes; we will announce and highlight changes, and your continued use means you’re okay with them. If not okay, you have the right to stop using Mediman (though we hope to address any concerns so you’ll stay). 15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</p>
        <p>This section sets out how disputes between you and Mediman will be handled, including the applicable law and mechanisms for resolving disputes (such as arbitration or courts). It also addresses how we’ll try to solve issues amicably first.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.1 Governing Law: This Agreement and any dispute or claim (contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or related to it or your use of the Platform shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka . We expressly exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and any other international conflict-of-law provisions.</h3>
        <p>However, we recognize that Mediman serves users in multiple jurisdictions:</p>
        <p>If you are a consumer (patient) located outside Sri Lanka, you may have certain mandatory consumer protection rights under the laws of your country of residence. Nothing in these Terms is intended to override those mandatory rights. For example, if you reside in a country that requires certain healthcare disclosures or allows certain claims despite a contract clause, those local laws will prevail to the extent they are mandatorily applicable. Similarly, any local healthcare regulations or consumer laws that are expressly applicable to a telehealth interaction in a given jurisdiction will take precedence for that interaction . For instance, if a law in the patient’s country says a telemedicine consent form must contain X, and our process is missing that, that law governs the interpretation or requirement for that consultation. For Practitioners, your local medical laws apply to your practice; our Terms don’t change that, though they are governed by Sri Lankan law as an agreement.</p>
        <p>In essence, Sri Lankan law governs the interpretation of this contract and the relationship, but we defer to local mandatory laws where relevant for particular user interactions.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.2 Good-Faith Negotiation: In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Platform (a “Dispute”), the parties agree to first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally . If you have a dispute with Mediman, you should notify us by contacting support or sending a written notice describing the dispute and your desired resolution. Similarly, if we have a dispute with you, we will contact you at the email or address on file with a description of the issue. We shall endeavor to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation within 30 days from the date the dispute notice is sent . This could involve calls, emails, or meetings to discuss the matter. Both sides agree to participate in such good-faith discussions before proceeding to formal proceedings.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.3 Arbitration (Binding): If we cannot resolve the Dispute through negotiation within 30 days (or an alternate timeframe by mutual agreement), then, except as provided under “Exceptions” below, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration . The arbitration will be conducted in English and administered in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration will be conducted under the Arbitration Act of Sri Lanka No. 11 of 1995 (as amended) . Mediman may elect a specific set of rules or an arbitral institution (for example, the Rules of the Institute for the Development of Commercial Law and Practice (ICLP) Arbitration Centre in Sri Lanka, or UNCITRAL rules with an appointed arbitrator), and will inform you in the notice to arbitrate or mutual agreement. The arbitration will be held before a single arbitrator, unless the parties agree to a panel of three. The arbitrator will have the authority to award any relief available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees if allowed by law, but the arbitrator may not award damages in excess of or inconsistent with Section 12 (Disclaimers & Liability). The decision of the arbitrator will be confidential, final and binding on the parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</h3>
        <p>By agreeing to arbitration, both you and Mediman are waiving the right to a trial in court and to have disputes resolved by a judge or jury, and (where permitted by law) you are waiving any right to participate in a class action or similar proceeding. You and Mediman agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.4 Exceptions to Arbitration: Despite the above agreement to arbitrate, either party may choose to pursue enforcement actions, or seek injunctive or equitable relief, in a court of competent jurisdiction for: (a) intellectual property disputes (for example, infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents, or misappropriation of trade secrets) ; (b) claims related to unauthorized use, piracy or theft of the Platform; or (c) any other matter for which arbitration is not permitted by law (some jurisdictions do not allow arbitration of certain disputes). Additionally, if the arbitration agreement is found unenforceable or not applicable to your claim by a court, then you and Mediman agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts as set forth below for resolution of that claim.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.5 Venue and Jurisdiction: Subject to the above arbitration clause, you and Mediman agree that any judicial action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Platform (including any confirmation or enforcement of an arbitration award) will be brought in the courts of Colombo, Sri Lanka . You and Mediman each consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the Colombo courts (and the appropriate appellate courts) and irrevocably waive any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum. If you are a consumer user and a court in your country would deem this choice of Colombo courts as unenforceable (due to consumer law granting local jurisdiction, for example), then the minimum extent of that local law applies.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.6 Legal Fees and Costs: In any dispute, arbitration, or court proceeding between us, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party, including those incurred in arbitration, at trial, or on any appeal or petition, except as may be limited by consumer law or unless the arbitrator/judge directs otherwise (for example, some arbitration regimes have rules about not awarding fees to not discourage claims).</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.7 Time Limits: To the extent permitted by law, any dispute or claim you might have against Mediman must be brought within one (1) year after the event or facts giving rise to the claim occurred, or such claim will be forever waived and barred. (This does not apply to claims by Practitioners for earned fees or similar statutory claims which by law cannot be shortened; it mainly aims at contract or tort claims.)</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15.8 Opt-Out (for new users): If you do not wish to agree to arbitration and you are a new user, you have 30 days from the date you first agree to these Terms to opt-out of the arbitration agreement by sending us a written opt-out notice including your name, account email, and a clear statement that you do not agree to arbitration of disputes with Mediman. Send this to our contact address in Section 19. If you opt-out, Section 15.3 (Arbitration) will not apply to you. Opting out of arbitration has no effect on the rest of these Terms. If you have previously agreed to an arbitration clause with us and not opted out, that earlier clause continues (with the updated terms here).</h3>
        <p>We aim to maintain amicable relationships and address issues proactively. Most user concerns can be resolved simply by contacting our support team – we encourage you to do so before formalizing any dispute. 16. Force Majeure</p>
        <p>Mediman shall not be liable or deemed in breach of these Terms for any delay or failure in performance (excluding any payment obligations) resulting from events, circumstances, or causes beyond its reasonable control (each a “Force Majeure Event”). Such events include, but are not limited to: natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), fire or explosion, war, terrorism, civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, acts of government or regulatory authorities (such as lockdowns, quarantines, bans), embargoes or blockades, national or regional emergency, strikes or labor disputes (excluding those involving Mediman’s own workforce), failures or outages of power, internet or telecommunications, and other events commonly understood to be force majeure .</p>
        <p>During a Force Majeure Event, the obligations of the affected party are suspended to the extent they cannot be performed due to the event. The affected party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the event and to resume full performance as soon as reasonably possible. For example, if our data center is hit by an earthquake causing service outage, we will work diligently to transfer operations to a backup facility.</p>
        <p>If the Force Majeure Event continues for an extended period (e.g., more than 30 days) such that it fundamentally frustrates the purpose of these Terms, either party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other without further liability (except that Users will be entitled to refunds for services paid for but not rendered due to the force majeure).</p>
        <p>Specific application to the Platform:</p>
        <p>Practitioner unavailability: If a Practitioner cannot attend a scheduled consultation due to a Force Majeure Event (e.g., sudden illness from a pandemic, or power outage due to a storm), they should inform the Patient or Mediman as soon as possible. Mediman will treat such cancellations leniently and may waive cancellation penalties for verified force majeure instances  . The Patient will receive a full refund for that appointment, and possibly assistance rescheduling after the event passes. Platform outage: If the Platform is down due to a Force Majeure (internet backbone issue, etc.), we will not be liable for any inconvenience or loss that results, but we will take steps to coordinate alternative solutions if possible (like rescheduling appointments). Users are encouraged to have contingency plans for critical medical needs, acknowledging that technology can fail in extreme situations.</p>
        <p>This clause does not excuse payment obligations that matured before the force majeure event, nor can force majeure be claimed for circumstances that a party could have overcome by reasonable diligence or expenditure. The duty to indemnify and confidentiality obligations are also not excused by force majeure (though obviously if communication is impossible due to the event, delays are understood).</p>
        <p>Both parties shall promptly notify each other of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event and keep each other reasonably informed of efforts to resume performance. 17. Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
        <p>This section covers several standard contractual provisions that clarify how the Terms should be interpreted and applied.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.1 Entire Agreement: These Terms, along with any documents expressly incorporated by reference (such as the Privacy Policy and any applicable guidelines or schedules), constitute the entire agreement between you and Mediman regarding the Platform and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and Mediman with respect to the Platform. This means that any earlier promises or agreements (unless incorporated here) are not binding once you agree to these Terms.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.2 Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable (if possible) or, if modification is not possible, severed (deleted) from these Terms . In any event, the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. For example, if the arbitration clause is found unenforceable, the rest of the contract remains valid.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.3 No Waiver: No waiver by Mediman of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of that term or any other term, and Mediman’s failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. For example, if you breach these Terms and we do not immediately enforce our rights or take action, that does not mean we’ve waived our rights to enforce them in the future or in any other situation.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.4 Assignment: You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without Mediman’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is void. Mediman may freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) to: (a) an affiliate or subsidiary; (b) an acquirer of Mediman’s business or assets; or (c) a successor by merger. These Terms are binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.5 Third-Party Beneficiaries: Except as expressly provided in these Terms, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. This means that no person or entity other than you and Mediman (and Mediman’s successors/assigns) has the right to enforce any of its terms. However, note that Mediman’s affiliates, officers, and employees are entitled to the benefit of the disclaimers and limitations of liability in Section 12, and for the purpose of those provisions, Mediman acts on their behalf. Also, any indemnified party can enforce the indemnity provisions.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.6 Relationship of Parties: The relationship between Mediman and Practitioners is that of independent contractors (and between Mediman and Patients, simply service provider and customer). Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, or fiduciary relationship between you and Mediman. You do not have any authority to bind Mediman in any way, and vice versa, beyond what is explicitly agreed. (This was stated earlier in Scope for practitioners but is restated as a general principle here.)</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.7 Headings and Interpretation: The section headings and summaries (if any) in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. In interpreting these Terms, no meaning shall be ascribed to headings. The words “including” or “includes” shall be deemed to be followed by “without limitation” or “for example” whether or not so stated. Any references to “days” mean calendar days unless specified as “business days.” In case of any ambiguity or inconsistency between the English version of these Terms and versions in any other language (if provided), the English version will control (unless prohibited by local law).</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.8 Notices: Where these Terms call for notice from Mediman to Users, we will use the methods described in Section 14 (e.g., email, postings). Notices from Users to Mediman (such as legal notices, breach notices, or requests to opt-out of arbitration) should be sent to the contacts in Section 19.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.9 Electronic Communications: You consent to receive communications from Mediman electronically, such as emails, texts, in-app notices, or postings on the Platform, and you agree that all terms, conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Mediman provides electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in writing.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.10 Export Controls: The Platform may be subject to export control laws of various jurisdictions, including the Sri Lankan Export Control laws, U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), etc. You agree to comply with all relevant export laws. For example, you confirm that you are not located in a country that is subject to U.S. sanctions or that has been designated by the U.S. as a “terrorist supporting” country, and you are not listed on any U.S. government denied-party list.</h3>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17.11 Contact for Questions: If you have any questions about these Terms or need clarification, you can contact us as outlined below. 18. Notices & Contact Information</h3>
